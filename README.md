# Loggy: A Java 8 Experiment #

Loggy is a simple testing project for playing with Java 8.  It's geared around the idea of processing a simple Apache log file using some of Java 8's new APIs.

## Ideas to investigate ##

* Streams API
* java.time package
* Lambdas, collections, and functional idioms

## Possible avenues to explore these in

* Aggregation and calculations of data in the log file (e.g. basic statistics, sorting, filtering, etc. etc.)
* Mechanisms for reading file(s)
* Mechanisms for parallelizing operations (may want to grab some much larger datasets to demo this)
