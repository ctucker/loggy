# Loggy: A Java 8 Experiment #

Loggy is a simple testing project for playing with Java 8.  It's geared around the idea of processing a simple Apache log file using some of Java 8's new APIs.

## Ideas to investigate ##

* Streams API
* java.time package
* Lambdas, collections, and functional idioms

## Possible avenues to explore these in

* Aggregation and calculations of data in the log file (e.g. basic statistics, sorting, filtering, etc. etc.)
* Mechanisms for reading file(s)
* Mechanisms for parallelizing operations (may want to grab some much larger datasets to demo this)


## Things to cover yet:

* More complex aggregation/stream operations
* Making the whole thing run on streams, not lists etc.
* Forking and joining (parallel streams)
* DateTime:
	* Date math
	* Time zones
	* Clock
	* Timeline
* try-with-resources
* Diamond operator
* default methods
* functional interfaces (SAMs)
* Type annotations
